Moment.js Day Planner
Application is color coded using Moment.js so that hour blocks in the future will be green, hour blocks in the past are grey, and the current hour block will be red. The current date is also dispalyed in the header. Users can save tasks or make notes in each hour block, and then save them to local storage using the save icon. The tasks/notes will still perist after refreshing or closing and reopening the page. Unfortunately the application is still not mobile responsive as of now.
